What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","  - A function is standalone and defined independently, callable directly without any object context.\n","   A method is a function defined within a class, associated with an object or class, and can access or modify object attributes using self. Methods are called on objects,\n","   while functions operate independently of objects.\n","\n","Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","  - In Python, function arguments and parameters are fundamental     \n","    concepts that deal with passing data to and from functions.\n","    Arguments are the actual values or data that you pass to the function when calling it.\n","    Parameters are placeholders defined in a function's signature. They specify the inputs that the function expects to receive.\n","    Function definition with parameters (x and y)\n","    def add(x, y): return x + y\n","\n","    Function call with arguments (3 and 5)\n","    result = add(3, 5)\n","\n","    print(result) # Output: 8\n","\n","Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n"," - there are several ways to define and call a function. Below are the different methods:\n","\n","  Basic Function Definition You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.\n","  Example:\n","\n","  Function definition\n","  def greet(name): return \"Hello, \" + name\n","\n","  Function call\n","  print(greet(\"Vishal\")) # Output: Hello, Vishal\n","\n","  Function with Default Parameters You can define default values for parameters. If the caller doesn't provide a value for that parameter, the default is used.\n","  Example:\n","\n","  def greet(name=\"Guest\"): return \"Hello, \" + name\n","\n","  print(greet()) # Output: Hello, Guest print(greet(\"Eon\")) # Output: Hello, Eon Function with Variable Number of Arguments (*args) You can define a function that accepts a variable number of arguments using *args.\n","\n","  Example:\n","\n","  def greet(*names): for name in names: print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n","\n","  greet(\"Vishal\", \"Rahul\", \"Eon\")\n","\n","  Output:\n","  Hello, Vishal\n","  Hello, Rahul\n","  Hello, Eon\n","\n","Q4.What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n"," - The purpose of the return statement in a Python function is to send a result or value back to the caller. It allows the function to provide an output after performing its operations, which can then be used or stored in a variable.\n","\n","  Example:-\n","\n","  def add(x, y): result = x + y return result # This sends the result back to the caller\n","\n","  sum_value = add(3, 5) # Calling the function and storing the returned value print(sum_value) # Output: 8\n","   \n","Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n"," -  Iterable: An object that can be looped over (like a list, string, or tuple). It provides an iterator when you call iter() on it.\n","\n","  Iterator: An object that keeps track of the current position and gives you one item at a time when you call next().\n","\n","Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n"," - Generators in Python are a type of iterable that allows lazy evaluation, generating items one at a time as needed, rather than all at once. They are defined using a function containing the yield keyword, which pauses the function’s state and resumes it on subsequent calls, enabling efficient memory usage.     \n"," Generators in Python are a type of iterable that allows lazy evaluation, generating items one at a time as needed, rather than all at once. They are defined using a function containing the `yield` keyword, which pauses the function’s state and resumes it on subsequent calls, enabling efficient memory usage.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","def count_up_to(n):\n","    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n","        yield i\n","\n","gen = count_up_to(5)\n","print(next(gen))  # Output: 1\n","print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n","\n","Q7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n"," - Generators have several advantages over regular functions when it comes to handling large data or sequences.\n","\n","  Advantages of Generators: Memory Efficiency:\n","\n","  Generators do not store all values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values one at a time when needed, which is more efficient for large datasets. Lazy Evaluation:\n","\n","  Generators only calculate values when they are required. This means they don’t do unnecessary work, which can improve performance. Convenience:\n","\n","  Generators are often easier to write and more readable for iterating over data compared to creating complex loops.\n","\n","  Example:-\n","\n","  Regular Function (Returns all values at once):\n","\n","  def get_numbers(): numbers = [] for i in range(1, 6): numbers.append(i) return numbers\n","\n","  result = get_numbers() print(result) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","\n","  Generator (Yields values one by one):\n","\n","  def get_numbers(): for i in range(1, 6): yield i\n","\n","  generator = get_numbers() print(next(generator)) # Output: 1 print(next(generator)) # Output: 2 print(next(generator)) # Output: 3 print(next(generator)) # Output: 4 print(next(generator)) # Output: 5\n","\n","Q8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n"," - A lambda function in Python is a small, simple function that is defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of inputs but only has one line of code that gets executed, and it automatically returns a result.\n","\n","  syntax:-\n","  lambda arguments: expression\n","\n","  Example:-\n","  A lambda function that adds two numbers\n","  add = lambda x, y: x + y\n","\n","  Calling the lambda function\n","  print(add(3, 5)) # Output: 8\n","\n","  Use of Lambda:-\n","\n","  Small, one-time tasks: When you need a quick function that doesn't need a full definition with def. Passing as arguments: Often used in functions like map(), filter(), or sorted() where you need a simple function temporarily.\n","\n","Q9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python\n","- The map() function in Python is used to apply a function to each item in a collection (like a list, tuple, or string). It helps you process each element in the collection without needing to write a loop.\n","\n","  Purpose:\n","\n","  The main purpose of map() is to apply a function to every item in an iterable (a list, for example) and return a new collection with the results. Syntax:\n","\n","  map(function, iterable)\n","\n","  function: The function that will be applied to each item in the iterable. iterable: The collection (like a list or tuple) of items you want to modify.\n","\n","  Example:\n","\n","  A function that squares a number\n","  def square(x): return x * x\n","\n","  A list of numbers\n","  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","\n","  Apply the square function to each number in the list using map()\n","  squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n","\n","  Convert the map object to a list and print the result\n","  print(list(squared_numbers)) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]  \n","\n","Q10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python ?\n"," - The map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python are all used to process collections (like lists or tuples), but they have different purposes and behaviors.\n","\n","  map() function: Purpose: Applies a function to every item in a collection (like a list) and returns a new collection with the results. Output: A new collection (like a list) with transformed items. Example:\n","  Function to square a number\n","  def square(x): return x * x\n","\n","  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","  Using map to square each number in the list\n","  squared_numbers = map(square, numbers) print(list(squared_numbers)) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16] 2. reduce() function: Purpose: Applies a function to reduce a collection of items into a single value (it works by combining items one by one). Output: A single result after combining all the items.\n","\n","  Example:\n","\n","  from functools import reduce\n","\n","  Function to add two numbers\n","  def add(x, y): return x + y\n","\n","  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","  Using reduce to sum all the numbers in the list\n","  total = reduce(add, numbers) print(total) # Output: 10 3. filter() function: Purpose: Filters the items in a collection based on a condition. It keeps only the items for which the function returns True. Output: A new collection with only the items that meet the condition.\n","\n","  Example:\n","\n","  Function to check if a number is even\n","  def is_even(x): return x % 2 == 0\n","\n","  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","  Using filter to keep only even numbers\n","  even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers) print(list(even_numbers)) # Output: [2, 4]  \n","\n","Q11.
